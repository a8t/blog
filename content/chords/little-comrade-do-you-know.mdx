# Intro

Music and lyrics by Ma Jai, originally in Mandarin. 
Huge thanks to Marcus Wu for transcribing the song in Pinyin for me.

Ma Jai sang this song at the ICHRP Global Assembly in Hong Kong in 2019. Paraphrasing, he said:

This song is a children's song. Some friends and I, we rewrote the lyrics.
Now, it's still a children's song, but it's a very progressive children's song.
It's very simple. It's a conversation between an adult and a child. It goes like this:
 
> Little friend, do you know where the clothing we wear comes from?
> 
> Yes, I know! It was stitched by the workers!
> 
> Little friend, do you know where the food we eat comes from?
> 
> Yes, I know! It was grown by the farmers!
> 
> Little friend, do you know where the wealth of the nation comes from?
> 
> Yes, I know! It was built by the people!

I like it a lot. Children can know and understand these things. They deserve to be conscious. 
We shouldn't underestimate the capacity of the children to do great things in this world.

Here's a recording:
