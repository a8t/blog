description: "To the tune of the Official IRA's Army of the People"

This is an Official IRA song, called _The Army of the People_. We rewrote it 
to be about the New People's Army (NPA) in the Philippines. 

Like the heroic struggle of the Irish people against hundreds of years of English rule,
the Philippine struggle for liberation against US imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism 
continues today [(learn more here)](/blog/2020/07/16/psr/). The civil war in the Philippines
is a war against foreign domination, exploitation, poverty, and suffering. 

The NPA is the army of the Filipino people in their war against the US and its puppets.
And because we love the people and hate their enemies, we cherish the NPA!
