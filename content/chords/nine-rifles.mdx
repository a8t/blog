## Excerpt from "Specific Characteristics of our People's War" by Jose Maria Sison
> FROM SMALL AND WEAK TO BIG AND STRONG
>
> We must recognize the balance of forces between us and the enemy. This is the first requirement
> in waging either an entire war or a campaign or a single battle. 
>
> As matters now stand, we are small and weak while the enemy is big and strong. 
> There is no doubt that he is extremely superior to us militarily in such specific terms as number
> of troops, formations, equipment, technique, training, foreign assistance and supplies in general. 
> It will take a protracted period of time for us to change this balance of forces in our favor. 
>
> Thus, protractedness is a basic characteristic of our people’s war
