# Intro

Music and lyrics by Danny Fabella / [Musikang Bayan](https://www.facebook.com/Musikangbayan).

This is a song from the perspective of a youth writing to their parents about joining the revolution.
They say, "Mom, dad - I'm leaving home. I'm going to a war. I'm giving my time and my life for liberation."

If you want to know why there's a civil war in the Philippines, you can read [my short review of Philippine Society and Revolution here](http://localhost:6969/blog/2020/07/16/psr/).

I translated the lyrics into English [at the bottom](#interpretation).

This song is special to me, with lots of memories attached. 
It was the first Filipino language song that I learned. 
It was the song we sang in Mexico City during the CIDJAA in 2018. 
It was the song we performed in AB USA's Expo Despi in Manila in 2019.

I [wrote about my experiences](/blog/2019/11/28/youth-culture/) with the Filipino youth 
during my integration with the masses of Negros in 2019. 
Please read this to understand why the youth are the wellspring of the revolution in the Philippines.
