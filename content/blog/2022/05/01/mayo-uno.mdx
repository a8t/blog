On May 1st, 2022, forces opposed to the return of the Marcoses and Dutertes in the
ongoing Philippine elections gathered to celebrate International Worker's Day with a
Grand People's Rally in support of the Leni-Kiko presidential bid.

Over 120 people joined at Bathurst and Wilson Parkette, the Little Manila of Toronto.

I was asked to be the photographer for the day. I shot on my Fuji XT4 and Tamron 18-300mm.
Most photos are using the [Fujicolor Analog recipe from Fuji X Weekly](https://fujixweekly.com/2021/11/30/new-patron-early-access-film-simulation-recipe-fujicolor-analog/).
It was a gray and rainy day, but I think the pics turned out nicely.
