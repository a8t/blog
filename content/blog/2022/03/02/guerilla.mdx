###### A poem by Jose Maria Sison

The guerilla is like a poet  
Keen to the rustle of leaves  
The break of twigs  
The ripples of the river  
The smell of fire  
And the ashes of departure.

The guerilla is like a poet.  
He has merged with the trees  
The bushes and the rocks  
Ambiguous but precise  
Well-versed on the law of motion  
And master of myriad images.

The guerilla is like a poet.  
Enrhymed with nature  
The subtle rhythm of the greenery  
The inner silence, the outer innocence  
The steel tensile in-grace  
That ensnares the enemy.

The guerilla is like a poet.  
He moves with the green brown multitude  
In bush burning with red flowers  
That crown and hearten all  
Swarming the terrain as a flood  
Marching at last against the stronghold.

An endless movement of strength  
Behold the protracted theme:  
The people’s epic, the people’s war.
