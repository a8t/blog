![Zara Alvarez](./zara.jpg)

My friend and comrade/kasama Zara Alvarez was assassinated earlier today in her home in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, Philippines.
She was a human rights defender, paralegal for peasant farmers constantly under attack by the fascist state of the landlords and compradors in the Philippines.

Zara was one of my first guides when I got to Negros. She helped me get on my first jeepney! She taught me about the struggles of the people for land, water, and peace.

For first leg of my journey, Zara took me to a meeting she already had scheduled with six peasant women and their children, whose husbands had all been mass-arrested on fake charges. She interviewed them and gave them advice.

The day I left Negros Island, she wasn't able to see me off because she was called away on an emergency: the Philippine Army had entered a peasant village in the north of the island and was forcing them to sign "surrender" papers. She had to be there as a legal observer and advocate.

In the last week, two activists whose names appeared on the Philippine government's hit list in 2018 have been murdered. Negros island is one of the most heavily militarized, under what human rights group Karapatan Alliance Philippines (esp Karapatan Negros Island) calls "de facto martial law".

On Negros island alone, dozens and dozens of farmers, environmental activists, lawyers, and human rights defenders have been killed. Duterte's [Memorandum Order 32](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2018/11nov/20181122-MO-32-RRD.pdf) to send hundreds and hundreds of soldiers to act with impunity is to blame.

Zara knew how dangerous this work was. She did it anyway.

That's how I will remember Zara â€“ as a tireless defender of the people. She was a hero and should be remembered as one.
